DOMAIN BEHAVIORS AND RULES IMPLEMENTATION
==========================================

SUMMARY:
- 39 files created
- 9 files modified  
- 0 directory structure changes
- All changes comply with memory-bank constraints

IMPLEMENTED PATTERNS:
✓ Aggregate factories enforcing invariants
✓ Immutable domain events with collect/clear on aggregates
✓ Behavior methods with state transitions and domain errors
✓ Reusable specifications/policies in domain
✓ Typed domain error hierarchy
✓ Application layer event publishing

COMPLIANCE:
✓ No Firebase shapes in domain layer (verified)
✓ No Observable/RxJS in domain layer (verified)
✓ All repositories use Promise only (verified)
✓ All use cases use Promise only (verified)
✓ Aggregate factories enforce invariants
✓ Domain events are immutable
✓ Events collected/cleared properly
